## Parallel Computing : 
+It is the use of multiple processing elements simultaneously for solving any problem. Problems are broken down into instructions and are solved concurrently as each resource that has been applied to work is working at the same time. 

+ Advantages of Parallel Computing over Serial Computing are as follows: 

+ It saves time and money as many resources working together will reduce the time and cut potential costs. 
+ It can be impractical to solve larger problems on Serial Computing. 
+ It can take advantage of non-local resources when the local resources are finite. 
+ Serial Computing ‘wastes’ the potential computing power, thus Parallel Computing makes better work of the hardware.
